# AutoSync

> This is something I created when I was working on a project because I was mad at VSCode's Git.
> It was because I was modifying the Dev branch of a project, and VSCode reported an error when submitting.
> I simply wrote a tool to replace VSCode's submission and use Go to operate Git submission directly.

## How to use:

> Open the software, it will ask you for the project directory and synchronization interval, just enter it into the program, it will help you synchronize, and then that's it.
